1.15.1 - April 18, 2023
  ! Fixed a code injection issue where TotalFinder would fail to successfully inject on certain legacy / unsupported systems that were patched using OpenCore Legacy Patcher / OCLP. （※ Please note that this issue has nothing to do with the UEFI bootloader named OpenCore — TotalFinder has never had any known compatibility issues with the OpenCore UEFI bootloader.） [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  ! Fixed an issue where the new Coloured Labels logic would be unable to obtain the label colour of certain items that have coloured label information stored in a slightly different way than what was thought to be possible during testing. [Ventura]
  ! Fixed an issue where the new Coloured Labels logic would use the oldest label colour found on an item with multiple labels, instead of the newest. [Ventura]
  ! Fixed a rendering issue where the TotalFinder icon in the Finder preferences on macOS 11 Big Sur and newer would render with aliasing artifacts, especially on non-Retina/HiDPI displays where the issue was very severe. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur]
  ! Fixed a rendering issue where the TotalFinder icon in the Finder preferences on macOS 11 Big Sur and newer was unable to be tinted by the user's macOS UI tint colour when selected. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur]
  * Major internal refactors were made to the Coloured Labels feature, resulting in better optimisation of label colour lookup operations. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + Certain behaviour flags that were used during the testing of the new Coloured Labels logic are now controllable via TotalFinder's power-user-oriented "Tweakables" feature, which you can use by creating specific files in your home directory （<code>~</code>, or <code>${HOME}</code>） using the command-line utility <code>touch</code>. See below for more details. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + The newly-added Tweakable flag <code>~/.totalfinder-alwaysenablenewlabellookupmethods</code> enables the new Coloured Labels lookup logic on macOS 12 Monterey and below, which normally use a different label colour lookup method that no longer works as of macOS 13 Ventura. [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + The newly-added Tweakable flag <code>~/.totalfinder-disablelabelcolourlookupoptimisation</code> disables all Coloured Labels lookup optimisations, which may be useful as a troubleshooting or debugging step. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  * Made many improvements to the TotalFinder diagnostics utility （<code>diagnose-totalfinder.sh</code>） that improve the usefulness of its output. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + Added an experimental feature that allows users to make the Visor show above other apps, but not the Dock whenever the Visor is in a pinned state. This experimental feature is currently only accessible by running <code>defaults write com.binaryage.totalfinder TotalFinderVisorDrawAboveOtherAppsWhenPinned 1</code> in a Terminal session. （※ Replace the 1 with a 0 to disable the feature.） [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + A new Visor-related Tweakable flag was added: <code>~/.totalfinder-useaggressivevisordrawpriority</code> will set the Visor window to a much higher draw priority when the "Show on top of the Dock" feature is enabled. This can be useful if you encounter an app that is still able to draw above the Visor even with "Show on top of the Dock" enabled. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  * Various other internal refactors and improvements were made to TotalFinder as a whole. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]

1.14.2 - June 20, 2022

When enabled, this option will cause sidebar icons to display exactly how they would in Finder, which also disables the leftover skeuomorphic icons for the "Music", "Pictures", and "Movies" folders. （※ This option will also cause TotalFinder to ignore the user-custom ~/.totalfinder-sidebar-icons.plist file.）
  ! Fixed an issue where the Colorful Sidebar feature would not display most sidebar icons correctly on macOS 12 Monterey, macOS 11 Big Sur, and macOS 10.15 Catalina. [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  ! Fixed an issue where custom Finder icons applied using other macOS tweaks （such as IconChamp） would no longer display once TotalFinder was enabled. （※ To use custom Finder icons with TotalFinder enabled, please enable the "Use original Dock icon" option in the TotalFinder preferences.） [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  ! Fixed a layout issue that caused the localised string for "Freelance Windows" in the TotalFinder preferences to be cut off for some languages, like Japanese. [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]

  ! TotalFinder tabs render nicely on Retina MacBooks (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/retina_support-347pw">issue</a>)
  ! Visor auto-slides down when Finder loses active status. This should fix unreliable sliding historicaly based on losing keyboard focus (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/autohiding_visor_doent_work_reliably">issue</a>).
  ! No ghost windows after restarting (when Visor was pinned and up before restart).

1.2.5 - August 11, 2011
  + New Tab command opens default window location as set in General Finder Preferences. Previously it was opening the same location as the current tab. This was causing a lot of support requests because novices can be stuck in DMG view without sidebar (Lion does not have pill button anymore and CMD+OPT+T to show/hide toolbar with sidebar is not very well known keyboard shortcut).

  + TotalFinderCrashWatcher - a new improved way for reporting TotalFinder crashes.
  + Applications and scripts may now ask Finder via AppleScript if TotalFinder has been loaded (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-osax">more info</a>).
  + Alternative TotalFinder installation path may be specified via optional ini file (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-osax">more info</a>).

  * Tab animations are faster to match current Chrome settings.
  * Prevent tab icon jumping when switching to and from dual mode. Also put 2px space between icon and tab title.
  * Fixed tab focus problem when creating tabs by dragging folders into tab bar.
  * TotalFinder reports reasonable error message when fails launching.
  - TotalFinder is not using Spotlight anymore to locate TotalFinder.app if not found on standard location.

  + Compatibility with Finder 10.6.8 (which is included in OS X update 10.6.7).
  + Initial compatibility with OS X 10.7 (Lion). Please read <a href="https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/lion">Lion Compatibility Page</a> to get more info.

  * Moved traffic lights placement to match the Chrome (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/copy_chromiums_new_traffic_light_placement">issue</a>).
  * You can now move TotalFinder.app outside /Applications folder. Launcher uses Spotlight to locate TotalFinder.app if not found in /Applications. (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/totalfinder_stops_working_if_totalfinder_app_is_moved">issue</a> and <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/tf_will_not_launch_in_user_application_folder">issue</a>).
  * Asepsis checks presence of .DS_Store file, it does not do redirection when .DS_Store exists (see Console.app for affected folders). This fixes display of DMG backgrounds when Asepsis enabled.
  
1.1.5 - January 27, 2011
  + Added command-command, control-control and shift-shift activation options to Visor feature. To switch between them click the button image.

  + Added toolbar pill button to the top-right corner of the main chrome window. Yaay! (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/toolbar_pill_button_missing">issue</a>).
  * Sidebar and toolbar toggling should work more reliably and without visual glitches.
  * Using <a href="http://github.com/darwin/chromium-src-chrome-browser/commit/a460417f45efb3bf19aea54acbb782a968454a43">zombies</a> - better internal tracking of unintentional usage of deallocated memory. This should help me fix some remaining crashes.

  * After sliding Visor window down, in case TotalFinder has still main status, next visible window gets focus (Visor window does not keep it anymore).
  * Installed clearly states that current version is ALPHA and final version will be paid (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/payware">more info</a>).
  
0.6.4 - January 14, 2010
  + Finder window keeps main status. Originally I was setting tab-browser window as main and Finder window as key. TotalFinder should be more stable now.
  ! Labels via right click context-menu work again (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/labels_not_working">read more</a>).
  ! TotalFinder remembers position of last closed window, new window is reopened on the same position (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/totalfinder_finder_like_default_window_position">read more</a>).
  * Returning focus to previously active app should be a little bit faster.
  
0.6.3 - January 13, 2010
  ! CMD+TAB activation must be more strict. Activating Visor only in the case there is no other classic Finder window.
  
0.6.2 - January 13, 2010
  ! Regression introduced by CMD+TAB activation. Clicking on Desktop caused Visor to slide up.
  
0.6.1 - January 13, 2010

0.5 - December 18, 2009
  + Added tweak option "Don't customize Dock Icon".

  + Archive contains compatible SIMBL package (for case TotalFinder.dmg is found on Planet of the Apes).
  ! Quick TotalFinder restart from Preferences Pane is not counted as a crash.
  ! Using latest Sparkle which supports asynchronous package installation. This fixes installer choking when updating via Sparkle's "Install and Relaunch" button.
  
0.4 - December 9, 2009
  + Added option to force "Folders on Top".
  ! TotalFinder should work for users with 32-bit hardware (folks running i386 binary of Finder).
  
0.3 - December 6, 2009
  + Sparkle updating system. 
  + Added red face preventing continuous crashing during startup (because Finder is being restarted after crash by launchd).
  + Added uninstall script. 
  ! Changed TotalFinder window level so that auxiliary floating windows are visible on top of it (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/deactivate_always_on_top_window">more info</a>).
  ! Fixed Echelon registration into startup items. Previously Echelon wasn't started again after restart.

0.2.1 - November 30, 2009

  + .DS_Store redirect mode.
  + Visor-like hot-key activation.
  
0.1 - September - November, 2009
