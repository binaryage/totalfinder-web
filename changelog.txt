  * TotalFinder should feel much more responsive. I have optimized tab rendering, dragging and window layouting. Also some old windowing problems should be history.
  ! TotalFinder tabs render nicely on Retina MacBooks (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/retina_support-347pw">issue</a>)
  ! Visor auto-slides down when Finder loses active status. This should fix unreliable sliding historicaly based on losing keyboard focus (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/autohiding_visor_doent_work_reliably">issue</a>).
  ! No ghost windows after restarting (when Visor was pinned and up before restart).
  ! Prevent frozen Finder windows under Mountain Lion (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/issue_with_1_3_9">issue</a>)
  ! Fixed a possible crash during TotalFinder shutdown

  ! Symbolic links to folders sort as expected when "Folders on Top" is enabled.
  - Removed Asepsis feature and the kernel extension. Asepsis is now freely available as a <a href="https://asepsis.binaryage.com">standalone software</a>.
  
1.2.5 - August 11, 2011
  + New Tab command opens default window location as set in General Finder Preferences. Previously it was opening the same location as the current tab. This was causing a lot of support requests because novices can be stuck in DMG view without sidebar (Lion does not have pill button anymore and CMD+OPT+T to show/hide toolbar with sidebar is not very well known keyboard shortcut).
  ! Show/Hide Path Bar and Show/Hide Status Bar commands work reliably (even in dual mode).
  ! Resolved some rare crashes in Folder On Top feature.

  + TotalFinderCrashWatcher - a new improved way for reporting TotalFinder crashes.
  + Applications and scripts may now ask Finder via AppleScript if TotalFinder has been loaded (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-osax">more info</a>).
  + Alternative TotalFinder installation path may be specified via optional ini file (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-osax">more info</a>).

  * Tab animations are faster to match current Chrome settings.
  * Prevent tab icon jumping when switching to and from dual mode. Also put 2px space between icon and tab title.
  * Fixed tab focus problem when creating tabs by dragging folders into tab bar.
  * TotalFinder reports reasonable error message when fails launching.
  - TotalFinder is not using Spotlight anymore to locate TotalFinder.app if not found on standard location.

  + Compatibility with Finder 10.6.8 (which is included in OS X update 10.6.7).

  * Moved traffic lights placement to match the Chrome (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/copy_chromiums_new_traffic_light_placement">issue</a>).
  * You can now move TotalFinder.app outside /Applications folder. Launcher uses Spotlight to locate TotalFinder.app if not found in /Applications. (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/totalfinder_stops_working_if_totalfinder_app_is_moved">issue</a> and <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/tf_will_not_launch_in_user_application_folder">issue</a>).
  * Asepsis checks presence of .DS_Store file, it does not do redirection when .DS_Store exists (see Console.app for affected folders). This fixes display of DMG backgrounds when Asepsis enabled.
  
1.1.5 - January 27, 2011
  + Added command-command, control-control and shift-shift activation options to Visor feature. To switch between them click the button image.

  * The cut-operation cooperates better with system clipboard. (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/cutting_files_folders_and_finders_clipboard">issue</a>)
  * Tab switching should be a bit faster and window switching/dragging should not flicker.

  + Added toolbar pill button to the top-right corner of the main chrome window. Yaay! (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/toolbar_pill_button_missing">issue</a>).
  * Sidebar and toolbar toggling should work more reliably and without visual glitches.
  * Using <a href="http://github.com/darwin/chromium-src-chrome-browser/commit/a460417f45efb3bf19aea54acbb782a968454a43">zombies</a> - better internal tracking of unintentional usage of deallocated memory. This should help me fix some remaining crashes.

  ! Visor's Pin button is click-through.

Clicking right-side close button of dualized tab closes the right-side Finder panel properly (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/left_right_tab_closing_issue">issue</a> and <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/closing_right_pane_in_dual_mode_actually_closes_left_one">issue</a>).

  + New Tweak option 'Always Maximize' - makes Zoom behave like in Google Chrome.
  + New Tweak option 'Narrow Tabs Bar' - saves some vertical space for folks with 13" notebooks.
  + CMD+Q closes all open windows. This does not terminate Finder process tough.
  ! Fixed random crashes caused by pending tabs animations accessing already destroyed browser window.

  * Better logic for selecting target browser for a new tab: open it in visor if visor is visible and key window else use last active non-visor window.
  * Overall refactorings, dead code removal and speed improvements.
  * Dual panel separator line goes over toolbar and statusbar.
  - Removed close button on Visor window.
  - Removed continuous crash preventer code (not needed anymore).

  * Renamed some status menu items and added "Check for Updates" item.
  * Pixel perfect sidebar width syncing in dual mode.
