  + Fixed compatibility with Finder 10.8 under Mountain Lion (GM).
  + TotalFinder binaries are signed to make Gatekeeper happy.
  + Compatibility with Finder 10.7.5 (OS X update 10.7.5).
  - Removed support for Finder 10.6 under Snow Leopard.
  ! Fixed uploading of crash reports via CrashWatcher.
  * Improved stability and performance. I did big refactoring and code cleanup. Broken all features into separate TotalFinder "plugins".
  * Better performance of Visor sliding.
  * Resolved some additional situations causing "ghost" windows.
  * Slightly improved visual style of tab rendering. A few Retina tweaks copied over from Google's Chrome sources. Waiting for my Retina MBP to really test it.
  * Paths in tabs are truncated from the left (again).

1.3.4 - April 25, 2012
  ! Fixed broken right pane of Dual Mode under 10.7.4 (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/split_screen_problems_on_osx_10_7_4">issue</a>).

1.3.3 - April 24, 2012
  + Compatibility with Finder 10.7.3 (which is included in OS X update 10.7.4).

1.3.2 - December 3, 2011
  + Compatibility with Finder 10.7.2 (which is included in OS X update 10.7.3).
  * Improved performance when Folders on Top is enabled.
  ! Do not resolve symlinks when doing Cut&amp;Paste (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/cuting_symbolic_link_also_cuts_original_directory">issue</a>).

1.3.1 - October 25, 2011
  ! Resolved an issue causing 100% CPU usage when opening "All Files" with enabled Folders on Top (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/99_finder_cpu_load">issue</a>).
  ! Fixed a bug causing missing sidebars after opening DMG files (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/sidebar_not_appearing_in_new_tabs">issue</a>).

1.2.5 - August 11, 2011
  ! Finally fixed memory leaks in CrashWatcher (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/crashreporter_starts_excessive_memory_consumption">issue</a>).

1.2.4 - August 08, 2011
  ! Fixed AppleScript command for setting window bounds (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/lion_totalfinder_breaks_finder_window_tandem_scripts">issue</a>).

1.2.3 - August 08, 2011
  + New Tab command opens default window location as set in General Finder Preferences. Previously it was opening the same location as the current tab. This was causing a lot of support requests because novices can be stuck in DMG view without Sidebar (Lion does not have pill button anymore and CMD+OPT+T to show/hide toolbar with Sidebar is not a well-known keyboard shortcut).
  ! Resolved some rare crashes in Folder On Top feature.
  * The CrashWatcher was improved and <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/crashwatcher">open-sourced</a>. I've also resolved memory leaks.

  ! TotalFinderCrashWatcher: fixed improper path escaping when calling Ruby scripts - failed in 1.1.17 to upload crash logs.

1.1.17 - July 18, 2011
  ! Lion: New Asepsis was crashing under Lion (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/lion_gm_1_1_16_asepsis_totalfinder_kext_fails_total_finder">issue</a>).
  ! Lion: Fixed compatibility with Afloat and other SIMBL plugins which use <a href="https://github.com/rentzsch/jrswizzle">jrswizzle library</a>.
  * TotalFinderCrashWatcher: <a href="http://vgable.com/blog/2008/03/05/calling-the-command-line-from-cocoa/">more reliable way</a> of launching Ruby scripts and preventing multiple instances from running.

1.1.16 - July 17, 2011
  ! Improper placement of tab's popup menu (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/new_ui_bug_in_1_1_15">issue</a>).
  ! CrashWatcher didn't detect TotalFinder-related crashes reliably.
  ! Lion: Asepsis feature implemented from scratch (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/lion_bugs">issue</a>).

  ! Lion: Sidebar mirroring in dual mode works as under Snow Leopard.
  ! Lion: When switching tabs sidebar width stays the same as under Snow Leopard.
  ! Lion: Finder's file browser could freeze when opening folder with many files where Finder would display "More" icon.
  * Tab animations are faster to match current Chrome settings.
  * Prevent tab icon jumping when switching to and from dual mode. Also put 2px space between icon and tab title.

1.1.15 - June 22, 2011
  + It is possible to drag small tab icons (folder proxy icons) (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/re_enable_small_icon_dragging">issue</a>).
  * Fixed tab focus problem when creating tabs by dragging folders into tab bar.

1.1.14 - June 15, 2011
  + TotalFinderCrashWatcher - a new improved way for reporting TotalFinder crashes.
  + Applications and scripts may now ask Finder via AppleScript if TotalFinder has been loaded (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-osax">more info</a>).
  + Alternative TotalFinder installation path may be specified via optional ini file (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-osax">more info</a>).
  ! Fixed the annoying iPhoto issue (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/iphoto_isnt_playing_nicely_with_finder_or_automator_services">issue</a>).
  ! Fixed broken "open location" applescript event (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/problems_with_automator_or_applescripts">issue</a>).

  * TotalFinder reports reasonable error message when fails launching.
  - TotalFinder is not using Spotlight anymore to locate TotalFinder.app if not found on standard location.

1.1.13 - June 1, 2011
  ! Fixed crash reporter - report upload failed because of gist API changes.

1.1.12 - May 31, 2011
  + Major progress on <a href="https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/lion">Lion compatibility</a>.
  ! Fixed uninstaller - TotalFinder.osax wasn't removed properly.
  * Unfocused pinned Visor receives focus when activated. Second activation hides it.
  * Visor Pin state is persistent between TotalFinder restarts.
  * Sparkle offers update options during first launch (after installation).
  * Implemented URL scheme: totalfinder://register/[name]/[key] for better registering experience in the future.

1.1.11 - March 29, 2011

  * Asepsis checks presence of .DS_Store file, it does not do redirection when .DS_Store exists (see Console.app for affected folders). This fixes display of DMG backgrounds when Asepsis enabled.

  ! Fixed window displacement bug where tab was pulled out and returned back into the same window (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/dragging_a_tab_out_and_back_gives_graphics_artifacts">issue</a>).
