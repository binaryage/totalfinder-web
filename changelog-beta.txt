1.15.1 - April 09, 2023
  ! Fixed a code injection issue where TotalFinder would fail to successfully inject on certain legacy / unsupported systems that were patched using OpenCore Legacy Patcher / OCLP. （※ Please note that this issue has nothing to do with the UEFI bootloader named OpenCore — TotalFinder has never had any known compatibility issues with the OpenCore UEFI bootloader.） [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  ! Fixed an issue where the new Coloured Labels logic would be unable to obtain the label colour of certain items that have coloured label information stored in a slightly different way than what was thought to be possible during testing. [Ventura]
  ! Fixed an issue where the new Coloured Labels logic would use the oldest label colour found on an item with multiple labels, instead of the newest. [Ventura]
  ! Fixed a rendering issue where the TotalFinder icon in the Finder preferences on macOS 11 Big Sur and newer would render with aliasing artifacts, especially on non-Retina/HiDPI displays where the issue was very severe. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur]
  ! Fixed a rendering issue where the TotalFinder icon in the Finder preferences on macOS 11 Big Sur and newer was unable to be tinted by the user's macOS UI tint colour when selected. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur]
  * Major internal refactors were made to the Coloured Labels feature, resulting in better optimisation of label colour lookup operations. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + Certain behaviour flags that were used during the testing of the new Coloured Labels logic are now controllable via TotalFinder's power-user-oriented "Tweakables" feature, which you can use by creating specific files in your home directory （<code>~</code>, or <code>${HOME}</code>） using the command-line utility <code>touch</code>. See below for more details. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + The newly-added Tweakable flag <code>~/.totalfinder-alwaysenablenewlabellookupmethods</code> enables the new Coloured Labels lookup logic on macOS 12 Monterey and below, which normally use a different label colour lookup method that no longer works as of macOS 13 Ventura. [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + The newly-added Tweakable flag <code>~/.totalfinder-disablelabelcolourlookupoptimisation</code> disables all Coloured Labels lookup optimisations, which may be useful as a troubleshooting or debugging step. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  * Made many improvements to the TotalFinder diagnostics utility （<code>diagnose-totalfinder.sh</code>） that improve the usefulness of its output. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + Added an experimental feature that allows users to make the Visor show above other apps, but not the Dock whenever the Visor is in a pinned state. This experimental feature is currently only accessible by running <code>defaults write com.binaryage.totalfinder TotalFinderVisorDrawAboveOtherAppsWhenPinned 1</code> in a Terminal session. （※ Replace the 1 with a 0 to disable the feature.） [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  + A new Visor-related Tweakable flag was added: <code>~/.totalfinder-useaggressivevisordrawpriority</code> will set the Visor window to a much higher draw priority when the "Show on top of the Dock" feature is enabled. This can be useful if you encounter an app that is still able to draw above the Visor even with "Show on top of the Dock" enabled. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  * Various other internal refactors and improvements were made to TotalFinder as a whole. [Ventura] [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]

1.15.0 - January 10, 2023
  + Added full support for macOS 13 Ventura! [Ventura]

  + Added detection and user guidance for disabling SIP NVRAM protections, which is newly required as of macOS 13 for Apple Silicon machines only. [Ventura]

1.14.2 - June 20, 2022
  + Added a new user-configurable option to always use Finder icon rendering for the Colorful Sidebar feature. When enabled, this option will cause sidebar icons to display exactly how they would in Finder, which also disables the leftover skeuomorphic icons for the "Music", "Pictures", and "Movies" folders. （※ This option will also cause TotalFinder to ignore the user-custom ~/.totalfinder-sidebar-icons.plist file.）
  ! Fixed an issue where the Colorful Sidebar feature would not display most sidebar icons correctly on macOS 12 Monterey, macOS 11 Big Sur, and macOS 10.15 Catalina. [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  ! Fixed an issue where custom Finder icons applied using other macOS tweaks （such as IconChamp） would no longer display once TotalFinder was enabled. （※ To use custom Finder icons with TotalFinder enabled, please enable the "Use original Dock icon" option in the TotalFinder preferences.） [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]
  ! Fixed a layout issue that caused the localised string for "Freelance Windows" in the TotalFinder preferences to be cut off for some languages, like Japanese. [Monterey] [Big Sur] [Catalina]

  ! TotalFinder renders nicely on Retina MacBooks (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/retina_support-347pw">issue</a>)
  ! Visor auto-slides down when Finder loses active status. This should fix unreliable sliding historically based on losing keyboard focus (<a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/autohiding_visor_doent_work_reliably">issue</a>).

1.3.3 - April 24, 2012
  + Compatibility with Finder 10.7.3 (which is included in OS X update 10.7.4).

1.3.2 - December 3, 2011
  + Compatibility with Finder 10.7.2 (which is included in OS X update 10.7.3).

1.2.3 - August 08, 2011
  + New Tab command opens default window location as set in General Finder Preferences. Previously it was opening the same location as the current tab. This was causing a lot of support requests because novices can be stuck in DMG view without Sidebar (Lion does not have pill button anymore and CMD+OPT+T to show/hide toolbar with Sidebar is not a well-known keyboard shortcut).

  ! Lion: Finder's file browser could freeze when opening folder with many files where Finder would display "More" icon.

1.1.14 - June 15, 2011
  + TotalFinderCrashWatcher - a new improved way for reporting TotalFinder crashes.
  + Applications and scripts may now ask Finder via AppleScript if TotalFinder has been loaded (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-osax">more info</a>).
  + Alternative TotalFinder installation path may be specified via optional ini file (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-osax">more info</a>).
  ! Fixed the annoying iPhoto issue (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/iphoto_isnt_playing_nicely_with_finder_or_automator_services">issue</a>).
  ! Fixed broken "open location" applescript event (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/problems_with_automator_or_applescripts">issue</a>).

  * TotalFinder reports reasonable error message when fails launching.
  - TotalFinder is not using Spotlight anymore to locate TotalFinder.app if not found on standard location.

1.1.13 - June 1, 2011

1.1.12 - May 31, 2011
  + Major progress on <a href="https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/lion">Lion compatibility</a>.
  ! Fixed uninstaller - TotalFinder.osax wasn't removed properly.
  * Unfocused pinned Visor receives focus when activated. Second activation hides it.
  * Visor Pin state is persistent between TotalFinder restarts.
  * Sparkle offers update options during first launch (after installation).
  * Implemented URL scheme: totalfinder://register/[name]/[key] for better registering experience in the future.

  * Moved traffic lights placement to match Chrome (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/copy_chromiums_new_traffic_light_placement">issue</a>).
  * You can now move TotalFinder.app outside /Applications folder. Launcher uses Spotlight to locate TotalFinder.app if not found in /Applications.

  ! When cycling through windows skip the desktop window (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/_cycle_through_windows_menu_command_is_always_disabled_grayed_out">issue</a>).
  ! Fixed window displacement bug where tab was pulled out and returned back into the same window (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/dragging_a_tab_out_and_back_gives_graphics_artifacts">issue</a>).
  ! When sliding Visor up, visor window always appears on top of other TotalFinder windows.
  * The cut-operation cooperates better with system clipboard (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/cutting_files_folders_and_finders_clipboard">issue</a>)
