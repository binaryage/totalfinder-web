## Hide icon in Menu Bar

This is if you don't want to see TotalFinder's icon in your menu bar.

## Allow path copying from Context Menus

TotalFinder makes it really easy to capture a variety of path formats for a selected object.  Right-click on any file or folder, select Copy Path, and select the path format you'd like copied to the clipboard:
1. Posix Path
2. URL
3. Windows Path
4. UNC Path
5. HFS Path
6. Terminal Path

## Show CutPaste buttons in Context Menus

Although you can always use the keyboard shortcuts to cut, copy, or paste an object with TotalFinder installed, this menu option offers a button for each edit operation in the contextual menu.
